# tqmindmap
A simple Node-Express version of https://github.com/ondras/my-mind

A fairly quick hack to play with the Ondras my-mind mapper. This uses his pre-built javascript. 

To make my-mind.js:
* make  (tested only on a mac)
* copy my-mind.js to /public/javascripts

To use: 
* npm install

To run:
* npm start
* browse: http://localhost:3000/
* Use the Open File button to select one of the examples to browse
